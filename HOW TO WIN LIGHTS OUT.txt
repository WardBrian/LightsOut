This is used mainly to prove that each is solveable, as this algorithm always works on solveable boards


Light-chase (toggle lights under highest lit row) until only bottom is lit.
======= 5x5 =========
Then, follow this pattern and chase again until solved

Bottom  Top 
O---O	OO---
-O-O-	O--O-
OOO--	-O---
--OOO	---O-
O-OO-	----O
-OO-O	O----
OO-OO	--O--


======= 6x6 =========
If the light at A6 is on, press A1 and C1. 
If the light at B6 is on, press D1. 
If the light at C6 is on, press A1 and E1. 
If the light at D6 is on, press B1 and F1. 
If the light at E6 is on, press C1. 
If the light at F6 is on, press D1 and F1.

Chase again until solved
