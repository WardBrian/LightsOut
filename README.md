# LightsOut - A Classic Game, Also Implemented in Pythpn
A reimaginging of an old project from highschool. It is the basic game of Lights Out!, implemented with the py-cui Python TUI library. The game has two modes, for 5x5 and 6x6 versions of the game. Boards are generated randomly, and, by using some linear algebra (which I was studying at the time and super excited to include), guaranteed to be solveable.
