# LightsOut - A Classic Game, Implemented in Java
This project was completed for the final exam of my AP Computer Science course in high school. It is the basic game of Lights Out!, implemented with standard Java GUI libraries. The game has two modes, for 5x5 and 6x6 versions of the game. Boards are generated randomly, and, by using some linear algebra (which I was studying at the time and super excited to include), guaranteed to be solveable.
